# Maveligpt
This bot is about Maveli, who knows nothing about Onam!! He IS BUSY MAKING PAYASAM. BYE!!!
In crafting my Maveli GPT bot, I pulled together a quirky toolkit! First, I set up my digital workshop in *VS Code*, where I danced with *Python*—the programming language that’s as easy as pie. To give my bot a brain, I invited the *Transformers* library to the party, letting it spout off human-like text faster than I can make a cup of chai! For a dash of interaction, *SpeechRecognition* helped my bot eavesdrop on users, turning their chatter into text, while *pyttsx3* gave it a voice that could charm even the grumpiest Onam guest. With *googletrans*, my bot became a polyglot, ready to chat in multiple languages—who knew it was so cultured? Lastly, I employed *sqlite3* to help my bot remember all the juicy gossip from our chats, making it feel like a good friend. With these tools, my idea blossomed into a fun, chatty companion that’s ready to celebrate Onam!
